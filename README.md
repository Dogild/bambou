# bambou

Bends but does not break!


## description

`Bambou` is a Python ReST layer for Nuage Networks' APIs base concepts. It works on top of the `requests` library and provides an object oriented layer for manipulating ReST entities.

`Bambou` can not be used as is, and it's mainly used by the Nuage Networks' `vsdk` and `vspk`.
